1. node_modules/
This is the default folder that contains all the dependencies your project needs, including React, Expo, and any libraries you install.
2. assets/
This directory stores static resources like images, fonts, and icons that your app will use.
images/: Contains image files such as logos, background images, etc.
icons/: Stores icon assets, which might include app icons for different screen resolutions.
3. src/
Main source folder where all your application logic and code reside.

components/: Contains reusable UI components (e.g., buttons, headers, card components).

hooks/: Custom React hooks used for handling business logic, state management, or fetching data.

navigation/: Stores the navigation-related files, such as the setup for React Navigation (i.e., stack navigators, tab navigators, etc.).

screens/: Contains all the screen components that represent different views or pages in your app (e.g., HomeScreen, ProfileScreen, etc.).

services/: This directory holds business logic, such as API calls, authentication services, and data management.

store/: If you're using state management (such as Redux, Zustand, or Context API), this is where your store-related code will be.

utils/: Utility functions or helper files that are used across the app (e.g., date formatting, validation functions, etc.).

App.js: The entry point of your Expo app. It generally contains the root component and configuration for the app, such as setting up navigation, context providers, or the global layout.

4. Configuration and Meta Files
.expo/: Expo-specific configuration and cache files. You usually don’t modify this folder manually.

.git/: Git configuration files and repository data.

.gitignore: Specifies which files and directories Git should ignore when committing to the version control system (e.g., node_modules/, .expo/, etc.).

app.json: The main Expo configuration file. It contains settings like the app name, icon, splash screen, platform configurations, etc.

babel.config.js: The Babel configuration file used to transpile JavaScript code for React Native and Expo.

package.json: This file lists the project’s dependencies (e.g., react, react-native, expo, etc.) and scripts (e.g., start, build, test).

.eslintrc.js: ESLint configuration file to enforce code style and ensure quality across the project.

tsconfig.json (optional): If using TypeScript, this file configures the TypeScript compiler options.
